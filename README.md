## üéØ **SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE - ATTORNEY FOCUS**

### **1. Ironstone Surveying Email Admissions**
**Source**: [Ironstone Correspondence](01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md)
- *"This pin was set according to the deed"* - Admission of placement
- *"The pin was driven into the ground"* - Confirms fraud (marked as "found")
- *"we did not have documentation when we originally surveyed your property"* - Negligence admission
- *"this matter is closed... we will not provide you with any further service"* - Professional abandonment

### **2. Georgia Power Utility Trespass Admission**
**Source**: [Georgia Power Letter](01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md)
- *"waterline leading to and serving Georgia Power's fee-owned parcel"* - Admits unauthorized utilities
- **1984 Easement**: Limited to "ingress and egress" only - NO utilities authorized
- **Clear Violation**: Water lines exceed transportation easement scope

### **3. Seller Superior Knowledge**
**Source**: [Closing Documents](01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt)
- **Warranty Deed**: "BOUNDED NORTH BY SHORT BRIDGE ROAD **AND GEORGIA POWER COMPANY**"
- **Specific Knowledge**: Seller knew more than title company about Georgia Power involvement
- **Generic Language**: Used "easements of record, IF ANY" despite specific knowledge

### **4. 37-Year-Old Public Record**
**Source**: [1984 Plat Documentation](01_source_documents/1984_historical/)
- **Recorded**: June 12, 1984 - Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198
- **Professional Survey**: Registered Surveyor No. 1507 with precise metes and bounds
- **Easily Discoverable**: Basic plat book search would have found easement
