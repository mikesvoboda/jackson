## Easements & Restrictions

### Identified Easements
1. **30-foot Ingress/Egress Easement**
   - Non-exclusive perpetual easement for Georgia Power and others
   - Diagonal path across the property
   - **No permanent structures allowed within easement**
   - Referenced in Plat Book 8, Page 198, Butts County

2. **Road Right-of-Way Dedications**
   - Dedicated right-of-way areas along both road frontages
   - Must maintain proper setbacks from right-of-way lines

### Easement Restrictions
**Prohibited within easements:**
- Permanent structures of any kind
- Swimming pools, septic tanks, wells
- House trailers, fuel storage facilities

**Permitted with approval:**
- Driveways (with proper permitting)
- Fencing, landscaping, agricultural use
- Underground utilities (perpendicular crossings only)

## Zoning & Building Requirements

### Butts County R-3 Zoning Standards
- **Minimum heated space:** 1,400 square feet
- **Maximum building coverage:** 35% of lot area (17,220 sq ft maximum)
- **Maximum building height:** 35 feet
- **Building permit required** with House Location Plan

### Setback Requirements
- **Front setback:** 25 feet from Short Bridge Road right-of-way
- **Side setbacks:** 10 feet minimum from interior property lines
- **Corner side setback:** 25 feet from Spring Drive right-of-way
- **Rear setback:** 30 feet from rear property line
- **Utility clearance:** 25+ feet minimum from utility structures/poles

### Important Note on Easement Setbacks
- **No additional setbacks required** from easement boundary lines
- Can build right up to easement edge (but not within the easement itself)
- Must maintain clearance from actual utility structures/poles

## Survey Challenges & Complexities

### Geometric Complexity
1. **Irregular Pentagon Shape:** Unlike typical rectangular lots, this property has five sides with varying angles
2. **Multiple Curves:** Three separate curves (C-1, C-2, C-3) create complex boundary calculations
3. **Diagonal Easement:** The 30-foot easement cuts diagonally across the property, significantly impacting buildable area
4. **Corner Lot Constraints:** Dual road frontages require larger setbacks on two sides

### Survey Precision Requirements
- **Curved Boundaries:** Require precise arc calculations using radius, delta, and chord measurements
- **Bearing Accuracy:** All property lines defined by specific bearings (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- **Multiple Reference Points:** Survey references multiple deed books and plat books for verification

### Buildable Area Challenges
1. **Easement Impact:** The diagonal easement eliminates a significant portion of the property from development
2. **Setback Convergence:** Multiple setback requirements from roads, property lines, and easements create a constrained buildable envelope
3. **Optimal Placement:** Finding the largest possible building footprint requires careful geometric analysis

---

## Buildable Envelope Analysis

### Primary Constraints
1. **30-foot diagonal easement** - Creates a no-build corridor across the property
2. **25-foot front setback** from Short Bridge Road
3. **25-foot corner setback** from Spring Drive  
4. **30-foot rear setback** from rear property line
5. **10-foot side setbacks** from interior property lines

### Optimal Building Location
**Primary buildable area:** Southeastern portion of the property
- East of the diagonal easement
- South of the front setback line
- West of the side setback line
- North of the rear setback line

### Estimated Building Potential
Based on the irregular shape and multiple constraints:
- **Maximum building footprint:** Approximately 4,000-6,000 square feet
- **Practical building footprint:** 3,000-5,000 square feet
- **Recommended approach:** Custom architectural design to maximize usable space within constraints

## Site Development Considerations

### Utilities & Infrastructure
- **Septic System:** Required - must be located outside all easements
- **Well Water:** Likely required - coordinate location with septic system
- **Electrical Service:** Coordinate with existing utility easement
- **Driveway Access:** Primary access from Short Bridge Road

### Construction Planning
- **Survey Staking:** Professional survey staking essential for precise boundary location
- **Utility Coordination:** Required for any work near the easement corridor
- **Permit Requirements:** Building permit with detailed House Location Plan showing all setbacks
