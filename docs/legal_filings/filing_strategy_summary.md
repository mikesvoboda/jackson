## üî• **KEY EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ATTORNEY**

### **Jackson Title "Smoking Gun"**:
> Seller deed specifically mentions "GEORGIA POWER COMPANY" boundaries, but title company used generic "easements of record, IF ANY" - **seller knew more than the professionals**

### **Ironstone "Smoking Gun"**:  
> Email admission: "This pin was set according to the deed" + "driven into the ground" but survey shows "IPF" (Iron Pin Found) - **direct fraud evidence**

### **Case Timeline "Smoking Gun"**:
> 37-year-old public record (1984) missed by both professionals in 2021 - **inexcusable negligence standard**
