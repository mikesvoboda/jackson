---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### **A. Property Purchase and Survey Contract**

**6.** On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs purchased real property located at Lot A-2, Short Bridge Road and Spring Drive, Jackson, Georgia 30233, Land Lot 73, 9th District, Butts County, Georgia (the "Property").
**Source**: ```635:649:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**7.** In connection with the Property purchase, Plaintiffs retained Defendant to conduct a professional boundary survey of the Property.

**8.** Defendant agreed to provide professional surveying services in accordance with applicable professional standards and Georgia surveying regulations.

### **B. The Initial Survey and Professional Failures**

**9.** On December 23, 2021, Defendant delivered the initial survey of the Property to Plaintiffs via email.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**10.** Despite the existence of a recorded easement in favor of Georgia Power Company recorded in Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198 since 1984, Defendant's survey showed no easement on the Property.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**11.** The Georgia Power easement had been recorded in public records for thirty-seven (37) years and was easily discoverable through basic plat book research required by professional surveying standards.

**12.** Defendant's failure to discover this easement was a material breach of professional duty and surveying standards.

### **C. Pin Placement Fraud and Admissions**

**13.** On May 2, 2022, when questioned about a pin location, Defendant's office manager Heather Tumlin sent an email containing critical admissions regarding fraudulent conduct.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**14.** In said email, Defendant admitted: **"This pin was set according to the deed"** and **"The pin was driven into the ground."**

**15.** Defendant further stated: **"The exact coordinate for the pin is- N.1222153.447 E2384715.378"**

**16.** These admissions constitute direct evidence that Defendant placed the pin rather than finding an existing pin.

**17.** However, Defendant's survey marked this same pin as "IPF" (Iron Pin Found), which is a false representation that the pin was found rather than placed.

**18.** This constitutes intentional fraud in professional documentation, as Defendant knowingly misrepresented a placed pin as a found pin.

### **C-1. Suspicious Circumstances Suggesting External Pressure**

**18-A.** Upon information and belief, the circumstances surrounding Defendant's return to the Property to place the termination pin suggest external pressure or coordination with other parties.

**18-B.** Professional surveyors do not typically return to perform additional unpaid field work after completing and delivering a survey unless compelled by external circumstances.

**18-C.** The suspicious timing of Defendant's second site visit - after the initial survey showed no easement termination - followed by the sudden "discovery" of a pin marked as "IPF" suggests coordination designed to establish an easement path favorable to Georgia Power Company's interests.

**18-D.** No reasonable professional explanation exists for Defendant's voluntary return to perform additional costly field work, suggesting external pressure, compensation, or coordination that Defendant has concealed from Plaintiffs.

### **D. Coordinate Misdirection Fraud and Professional Deception**

**19.** Analysis of Defendant's coordinate claims reveals sophisticated professional fraud designed to conceal incomplete survey work.
**Source**: ```02_analysis/coordinate_fraud/comprehensive_coordinate_fraud_analysis.md``` - Section: Major Coordinate Fraud Discovery

**20.** On May 2, 2022, Defendant provided coordinates N.1222153.447 E2384715.378, claiming these were the "exact coordinates for the pin" marking the Guinn Drive easement termination.

**21.** Investigation reveals that these coordinates point to the **center of the Property** (likely the START of Guinn Drive), not the property boundary where the termination pin was actually located.

**22.** Defendant's coordinate misdirection constitutes deliberate professional fraud, as Defendant:
   a. **Knew the difference** between easement start and termination locations
   b. **Deliberately provided** coordinates for the wrong location  
   c. **Concealed incomplete work** by claiming coordinates were for the termination pin
   d. **Refused verification** by withholding coordinate data from the second survey

**23.** The coordinate misdirection fraud is evidenced by:
   a. Defendant's coordinates point to property center, not boundary
   b. Actual termination pin visible in second survey at different location  
   c. No coordinate data provided for actual termination pin location
   d. Professional abandonment when asked for verification

**24.** This coordinate misdirection scheme enabled Defendant to:
   a. Avoid completing professional boundary survey work
   b. Conceal the true extent of easement impact on the Property
   c. Charge for services not properly rendered
   d. Abandon professional responsibilities while claiming work was complete

### **E. Professional Abandonment and Admission of Negligence**

**25.** On May 27, 2022, after receiving documentation of the Georgia Power easement, Defendant sent an email containing additional damaging admissions.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**26.** Defendant admitted: **"we did not have documentation when we originally surveyed your property"**

**27.** Defendant further admitted: **"at your insistence removed the easement because we did not have documentation"**

**28.** These admissions constitute direct evidence of professional negligence in failing to conduct proper research before providing surveying services.

**29.** Most egregiously, Defendant concluded the email stating: **"this matter is closed... we will not provide you with any further service"**

**30.** This constitutes professional abandonment and refusal to correct known errors in violation of professional surveying standards.

### **F. Georgia Power Easement Confirmation**

**31.** On May 11, 2022, Georgia Power Company sent Plaintiffs a letter confirming the validity of its 1984 easement, referencing the recording in Butts County Book 8, Page 198.
**Source**: ```1:116:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**32.** This letter proved that the easement Defendant failed to discover was valid, recorded, and enforceable.

**33.** Georgia Power asserted continuous use since 1984 and claimed the easement as "the only means by which Georgia Power's fee-owned parcels currently have access to a public road."

### **G. Damages Resulting from Defendant's Misconduct**

**34.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's professional malpractice, coordinate misdirection fraud, and abandonment, Plaintiffs have suffered substantial damages including:

**35.** **Construction Delays**: Plaintiffs have been unable to proceed with planned construction due to survey inadequacies and easement uncertainties, resulting in delays of over three (3) years.
**Source**: ```1:193:02_analysis/timeline/case_timeline.md```

**36.** **Incomplete Survey Work**: Defendant's failure to locate easement termination points has left Plaintiffs without crucial buildable area information necessary for development.
**Source**: ```02_analysis/coordinate_fraud/comprehensive_coordinate_fraud_analysis.md``` - Section: Pin Analysis & Professional Deception

**37.** **Construction Cost Inflation**: During the delay period, construction costs have increased by 30-50%, resulting in additional costs of $120,000-$200,000.
**Source**: ```1:263:02_analysis/damages/construction_delays.md```

**38.** **Interest Rate Impact**: Mortgage interest rates increased from 3-4% to 6-7% during the delay period, resulting in additional financing costs of $192,000-$258,000.

**39.** **Lost Use**: Plaintiffs have been deprived of the use of their Property for residential purposes, suffering damages equivalent to rental costs of $72,000-$126,000.

**40.** **Professional Fees**: Plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur costs for independent surveys, legal fees, and expert witnesses to address Defendant's professional failures.

**41.** **Conspiracy and Coordination Damages**: Upon information and belief, Defendant's suspicious conduct suggests coordination with other parties to create fraudulent documentation, potentially subjecting Defendant to enhanced damages for conspiracy and joint liability with co-conspirators.

## IV. CAUSES OF ACTION

### **COUNT I - PROFESSIONAL MALPRACTICE**

**42.** Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1-41.
