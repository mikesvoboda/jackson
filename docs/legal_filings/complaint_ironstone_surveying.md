---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### **A. Property Purchase and Survey Contract**

**6.** On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs purchased real property located at Lot A-2, Short Bridge Road and Spring Drive, Jackson, Georgia 30233, Land Lot 73, 9th District, Butts County, Georgia (the "Property").
**Source**: ```635:649:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**7.** In connection with the Property purchase, Plaintiffs retained Defendant to conduct a professional boundary survey of the Property.

**8.** Defendant agreed to provide professional surveying services in accordance with applicable professional standards and Georgia surveying regulations.

### **B. The Initial Survey and Professional Failures**

**9.** On December 23, 2021, Defendant delivered the initial survey of the Property to Plaintiffs via email.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**10.** Despite the existence of a recorded easement in favor of Georgia Power Company recorded in Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198 since 1984, Defendant's survey showed no easement on the Property.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**11.** The Georgia Power easement had been recorded in public records for thirty-seven (37) years and was easily discoverable through basic plat book research required by professional surveying standards.

**12.** Defendant's failure to discover this easement was a material breach of professional duty and surveying standards.

### **C. Pin Placement Fraud and Admissions**

**13.** On May 2, 2022, when questioned about a pin location, Defendant's office manager Heather Tumlin sent an email containing critical admissions regarding fraudulent conduct.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**14.** In said email, Defendant admitted: **"This pin was set according to the deed"** and **"The pin was driven into the ground."**

**15.** Defendant further stated: **"The exact coordinate for the pin is- N.1222153.447 E2384715.378"**

**16.** These admissions constitute direct evidence that Defendant placed the pin rather than finding an existing pin.

**17.** However, Defendant's survey marked this same pin as "IPF" (Iron Pin Found), which is a false representation that the pin was found rather than placed.

**18.** This constitutes intentional fraud in professional documentation, as Defendant knowingly misrepresented a placed pin as a found pin.

### **D. Coordinate Fraud and False Precision Claims**

**19.** Analysis of Defendant's claimed coordinates versus actual survey data reveals significant discrepancies evidencing additional fraudulent conduct.
**Source**: ```02_analysis/coordinate_fraud/comprehensive_coordinate_fraud_analysis.md``` - Section: Professional Standards Analysis

**20.** Defendant claimed "exact coordinates" of N.1222153.447 E2384715.378, but actual DXF survey data shows the nearest point at N.1222153.692742 E.2384715.355801.

**21.** Investigation reveals that Defendant's claimed "exact coordinates" were over 100 feet away from the actual physical pin location, demonstrating deliberate coordinate fraud rather than measurement error.

**22.** Defendant's use of only 3 decimal places (versus professional standard of 6+ decimal places) further evidences unprofessional practices and false precision claims.

**23.** No coordinates matching Defendant's claims appear anywhere in legitimate survey documentation, suggesting they were approximated rather than measured.

### **E. Professional Abandonment and Admission of Negligence**

**24.** On May 27, 2022, after receiving documentation of the Georgia Power easement, Defendant sent an email containing additional damaging admissions.
**Source**: ```1:113:01_source_documents/surveys/ironstone_correspondence.md```

**25.** Defendant admitted: **"we did not have documentation when we originally surveyed your property"**

**26.** Defendant further admitted: **"at your insistence removed the easement because we did not have documentation"**

**27.** These admissions constitute direct evidence of professional negligence in failing to conduct proper research before providing surveying services.

**28.** Most egregiously, Defendant concluded the email stating: **"this matter is closed... we will not provide you with any further service"**

**29.** This constitutes professional abandonment and refusal to correct known errors in violation of professional surveying standards.

### **F. Georgia Power Easement Confirmation**

**30.** On May 11, 2022, Georgia Power Company sent Plaintiffs a letter confirming the validity of its 1984 easement, referencing the recording in Butts County Book 8, Page 198.
**Source**: ```1:116:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**31.** This letter proved that the easement Defendant failed to discover was valid, recorded, and enforceable.

**32.** Georgia Power asserted continuous use since 1984 and claimed the easement as "the only means by which Georgia Power's fee-owned parcels currently have access to a public road."

### **G. Damages Resulting from Defendant's Misconduct**

**33.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's professional malpractice, fraud, and abandonment, Plaintiffs have suffered substantial damages including:

**34.** **Construction Delays**: Plaintiffs have been unable to proceed with planned construction due to survey inadequacies and easement uncertainties, resulting in delays of over three (3) years.
**Source**: ```1:193:02_analysis/timeline/case_timeline.md```

**35.** **Incomplete Survey Work**: Defendant's failure to locate easement termination points has left Plaintiffs without crucial buildable area information necessary for development.
**Source**: ```02_analysis/coordinate_fraud/comprehensive_coordinate_fraud_analysis.md``` - Section: Pin Analysis & Professional Deception

**36.** **Construction Cost Inflation**: During the delay period, construction costs have increased by 30-50%, resulting in additional costs of $120,000-$200,000.
**Source**: ```1:263:02_analysis/damages/construction_delays.md```

**37.** **Interest Rate Impact**: Mortgage interest rates increased from 3-4% to 6-7% during the delay period, resulting in additional financing costs of $192,000-$258,000.

**38.** **Lost Use**: Plaintiffs have been deprived of the use of their Property for residential purposes, suffering damages equivalent to rental costs of $72,000-$126,000.

**39.** **Professional Fees**: Plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur costs for independent surveys, legal fees, and expert witnesses to address Defendant's professional failures.
