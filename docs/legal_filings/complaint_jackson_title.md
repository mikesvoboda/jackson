## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### **A. Property Purchase and Title Insurance**

**6.** On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs purchased real property located at Lot A-2, Short Bridge Road and Spring Drive, Jackson, Georgia 30233, Land Lot 73, 9th District, Butts County, Georgia (the "Property") for $10,000.
**Source**: ```635:649:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**7.** In connection with the Property purchase, Defendant issued an Owner's Title Insurance Policy No. [Policy Number] in the amount of $10,000.00 to Plaintiffs.
**Source**: ```430:430:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**8.** Defendant charged Plaintiffs fees for abstract/title search, title examination, and title insurance services as reflected in the HUD-1 Settlement Statement dated August 19, 2021.
**Source**: ```404:430:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

### **B. The 1984 Georgia Power Easement**

**9.** Unknown to Plaintiffs at the time of purchase, the Property was subject to a significant recorded easement in favor of Georgia Power Company.

**10.** On June 12, 1984, Georgia Power Company executed a deed to James Emory, Inc., recorded in Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198, reserving a "non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress and egress" affecting the Property.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**11.** Said easement was also recorded on a professional plat in Plat Book 8, Page 198, Butts Superior Court, prepared by Georgia Registered Surveyor No. 1507.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**12.** The easement is 30 feet wide with centerline descriptions and affects roads including "Guinn Drive" which crosses Plaintiffs' Property.

**13.** This easement had been recorded in the public records for thirty-seven (37) years at the time of Plaintiffs' purchase and was easily discoverable through basic title examination procedures.

### **C. Defendant's Professional Negligence**

**14.** Despite conducting an abstract and title search, and despite examining title to the Property, Defendant failed to discover the 1984 Georgia Power easement.

**15.** Defendant's Warranty Deed to Plaintiffs contained only generic language stating: "THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PROPERTY IS CONVEYED SUBJECT TO ALL EASEMENTS AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OF RECORD, IF ANY."
**Source**: ```593:594:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**16.** The phrase "IF ANY" demonstrates that Defendant was unaware of any specific recorded easements, including the 1984 Georgia Power easement.

**17.** Had Defendant conducted a reasonable title examination, the 1984 easement would have been discovered and disclosed to Plaintiffs prior to purchase.

### **D. Discovery and Confirmation of Easement**

**18.** In May 2022, Georgia Power Company sent Plaintiffs a letter asserting its easement rights, referencing the 1984 deed and recording in Butts County Book 8, Page 198.
**Source**: ```1:116:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**19.** Georgia Power claimed continuous use of the easement since 1984 and asserted it was "the only means by which Georgia Power's fee-owned parcels currently have access to a public road."

**20.** The Georgia Power letter attached copies of the 1984 deed and plat, confirming the easement's validity and scope.

### **E. Damages Resulting from Defendant's Negligence**

**21.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's failure to discover and disclose the easement, Plaintiffs have suffered substantial damages including:

**22.** **Construction Delays**: Plaintiffs have been unable to proceed with planned construction due to uncertainty about buildable area, resulting in delays of over three (3) years.
**Source**: ```1:193:02_analysis/timeline/case_timeline.md```

**23.** **Construction Cost Inflation**: During the delay period, construction costs have increased by 30-50%, resulting in additional costs of $120,000-$200,000.
**Source**: ```1:263:02_analysis/damages/construction_delays.md```

**24.** **Interest Rate Impact**: Mortgage interest rates increased from 3-4% to 6-7% during the delay period, resulting in additional financing costs of $192,000-$258,000.
**Source**: ```1:263:02_analysis/damages/construction_delays.md```

**25.** **Lost Use**: Plaintiffs have been deprived of the use of their Property for residential purposes, suffering damages equivalent to rental costs of $72,000-$126,000.

**26.** **Property Value Diminution**: The undisclosed easement affects the buildable area and marketability of the Property, reducing its value by $50,000-$150,000.

**27.** **Professional Fees**: Plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees, expert witness costs, and other professional expenses in addressing the title defect.
