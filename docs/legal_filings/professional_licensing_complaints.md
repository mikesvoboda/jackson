### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

**Survey Services Contracted**: Ironstone Surveying was contracted to provide professional boundary survey services for property purchased on August 19, 2021.

**Professional Failures**: Ironstone failed to discover a 37-year-old recorded easement (Georgia Power Company, recorded 1984, Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198) despite this easement being easily discoverable through basic plat book research.

**Documented Admissions**: Ironstone provided written admissions of professional misconduct in email communications dated May 2, 2022, and May 27, 2022.

### **SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL VIOLATIONS**

#### **1. FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTATION (O.C.G.A. ¬ß 43-15-19)**

**Violation**: Marking placed survey pin as "IPF" (Iron Pin Found) when it was actually placed by surveyor.

**Evidence**: 
- May 2, 2022 email: *"This pin was set according to the deed"* and *"The pin was driven into the ground"*
- Survey documentation marks same pin as "IPF" (Iron Pin Found)
- **Direct contradiction** between email admissions and professional survey documentation

**Professional Standard Violated**: Accurate documentation and truthful marking of survey monuments per Georgia surveying regulations.

#### **2. FALSE PRECISION CLAIMS (Professional Standards)**

**Violation**: Claiming "exact coordinates" with insufficient precision and false accuracy.

**Evidence**:
- Email claim: *"The exact coordinate for the pin is- N.1222153.447 E2384715.378"*
- **Only 3 decimal places** vs. professional standard of 6+ decimal places

**Evidence**:
- May 27, 2022 admission: *"we did not have documentation when we originally surveyed your property"*
- **37-year-old recorded easement** in same county, easily discoverable
- **Basic plat book search** would have revealed easement
- **Professional duty** to research recorded documents before surveying

**Professional Standard Violated**: Due diligence requirements for boundary survey research and easement discovery.

#### **4. INCOMPLETE PROFESSIONAL WORK (Professional Standards)**

**Violation**: Delivering incomplete survey that failed to locate easement termination points.

**Evidence**:
- **Easement start point only** - failed to determine where easement terminates
- **No buildable area calculation** despite easement impact
- **Incomplete boundary determination** leaving clients without essential information
- **Professional abandonment** when correction requested

**Professional Standard Violated**: Complete and thorough survey work providing all necessary boundary information.

#### **5. PROFESSIONAL ABANDONMENT (O.C.G.A. ¬ß 43-15-19)**

**Violation**: Refusing to correct known professional errors and abandoning professional responsibilities.

**Evidence**:
- May 27, 2022 email: *"this matter is closed... we will not provide you with any further service"*
- **Refusal to correct** admitted errors and omissions
- **Professional abandonment** when confronted with mistakes
