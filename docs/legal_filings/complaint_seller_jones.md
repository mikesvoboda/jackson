---

**2.** Upon information and belief, Defendant KENNETH JONES, JR. is an individual resident of the State of Georgia.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

**4.** This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Florida Statutes ยง 48.193, as Defendant engaged in real estate transactions with Florida residents, caused damages to Florida residents, and the claims arise from Defendant's conduct affecting Florida residents' property interests.

**5.** Venue is proper in Manatee County, Florida, as:
   a. Plaintiffs are full-time residents of Manatee County, Florida
   b. Plaintiffs have suffered damages in Florida from Defendant's breach of warranty and non-disclosure
   c. The real estate transaction was entered into with Florida residents
   d. The economic impact and damages from the title defect are felt in Florida where Plaintiffs reside

**6.** Defendant is subject to Florida's long-arm jurisdiction as he conducted real estate transactions with Florida residents and caused injury to Florida residents through breach of warranty and failure to disclose material facts.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### **A. Property Sale and Warranty Deed**

**6.** On August 19, 2021, Defendant sold real property to Plaintiffs located at Lot A-2, Short Bridge Road and Spring Drive, Jackson, Georgia 30233, Land Lot 73, 9th District, Butts County, Georgia (the "Property") for $10,000.
**Source**: ```635:649:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**7.** The sale was documented by a Warranty Deed executed by Defendant in favor of Plaintiffs.
**Source**: ```575:649:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**8.** In the Warranty Deed, Defendant warranted title to the Property and stated: "I warrant the title to said land against the lawful claims of all persons."

### **B. The Georgia Power Easement**

**9.** Unknown to Plaintiffs at the time of purchase, the Property was subject to a significant recorded easement in favor of Georgia Power Company.

**10.** On June 12, 1984, Georgia Power Company executed a deed recorded in Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198, reserving a "non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress and egress" affecting the Property.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**11.** This easement was recorded thirty-seven (37) years before Defendant's sale to Plaintiffs and was a matter of public record.

**12.** The easement affects a substantial portion of the Property, including a road designated as "Guinn Drive" that crosses the Property.

### **C. Defendant's Knowledge of Easement**

**13.** Defendant's Warranty Deed contains specific boundary descriptions that demonstrate knowledge of Georgia Power's interest in the Property.

**14.** The deed specifically states the Property is: "BOUNDED NORTH BY SHORT BRIDGE ROAD **AND GEORGIA POWER COMPANY**, EAST BY **GEORGIA POWER COMPANY**"
**Source**: ```641:645:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**15.** By specifically identifying "GEORGIA POWER COMPANY" as a boundary element in two locations, Defendant demonstrated actual knowledge of Georgia Power's interest in adjacent or overlapping areas.

**16.** This specific identification suggests Defendant had superior knowledge of Georgia Power's rights compared to the generic "easements of record, if any" language in the deed.

**17.** Upon information and belief, Defendant owned the Property for a substantial period and should have been aware of the easement through his ownership and use of the Property.

### **D. Failure to Disclose Material Information**

**18.** Despite apparent knowledge of Georgia Power's boundary relationship to the Property, Defendant failed to specifically disclose the recorded easement to Plaintiffs.

**19.** The Warranty Deed contained only generic language stating: "THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PROPERTY IS CONVEYED SUBJECT TO ALL EASEMENTS AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OF RECORD, IF ANY."
**Source**: ```593:594:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**20.** The phrase "IF ANY" suggests uncertainty about specific easements, despite Defendant's apparent knowledge of Georgia Power's involvement with the Property boundaries.

**21.** A reasonable seller with knowledge of a major utility easement affecting buildable area would specifically disclose such information to purchasers.

### **E. Breach of Warranty and Damages**

**22.** Defendant's warranty of title was breached by the undisclosed easement that materially affects the Property's use and value.

**23.** The Georgia Power easement was confirmed in a May 11, 2022 letter from Georgia Power asserting continuous use since 1984 and claiming it as essential access to their fee-owned parcels.
**Source**: ```1:116:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**24.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's failure to disclose the easement, Plaintiffs have suffered damages including:

**25.** **Reduced Property Value**: The undisclosed easement significantly affects the buildable area and marketability of the Property.

**26.** **Construction Delays**: Plaintiffs have been unable to proceed with planned construction due to easement uncertainties.
**Source**: ```1:193:02_analysis/timeline/case_timeline.md```

**27.** **Lost Opportunity**: Had Plaintiffs known of the easement, they could have negotiated a reduced purchase price or chosen a different property.

**28.** **Additional Costs**: Plaintiffs have incurred expenses for legal advice, surveying, and other professional services to address the title defect.
