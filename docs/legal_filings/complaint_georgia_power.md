## **II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

### **A. Property Ownership and Georgia Power's Historical Interest**

**7.** On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs purchased real property located at Lot A-2, Short Bridge Road and Spring Drive, Jackson, Georgia 30233, Butts County, containing approximately 1.129 acres ("Property").
**Source**: ```1:400:01_source_documents/2021_closing/title_documents.txt```

**8.** The Property is part of a larger subdivision originally owned by Georgia Power Company and subdivided in 1984.

**9.** On June 12, 1984, Georgia Power Company, as Grantor, executed a deed to James Emory, Inc., recorded in Butts County Book 8, Pages 196-198, covering over 107 acres including the area that would become Plaintiffs' Property.
**Source**: ```1:114:01_source_documents/1984_historical/georgia_power_deed.md```

### **B. Limited Scope of Reserved Easement Rights**

**10.** In the 1984 deed, Georgia Power Company specifically reserved a "**non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress and egress**" along certain roads including Guinn Drive, which affects Plaintiffs' Property.
**Source**: ```1:77:01_source_documents/1984_historical/butts_county_records/plat_documentation.txt```

**11.** The easement reservation was explicitly limited to "**ingress and egress**" purposes only, meaning vehicular access and transportation.

**12.** The 1984 easement contains **no authorization** for utilities, water lines, sewer lines, electrical infrastructure, or any other non-transportation uses.

**13.** The easement is 30 feet wide with centerline descriptions and affects roads including Guinn Drive, which crosses Plaintiffs' Property.
**Source**: ```20:55:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

### **C. Georgia Power's Unauthorized Utility Use**

**14.** On May 11, 2022, Georgia Power Company sent Plaintiffs a letter asserting its easement rights and making a startling admission about unauthorized utility use.
**Source**: ```1:124:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**15.** In this letter, Georgia Power specifically stated: *"We also understand you or your agent may have cut a **waterline leading to and serving Georgia Power's fee-owned parcel**. While we are not clear on the facts at this moment, Georgia Power hereby reserves any and all rights with respect to the destruction of Georgia Power property."*
**Source**: ```79:82:01_source_documents/legal_notices/georgia_power_letter_2022-05-11.md```

**16.** This admission reveals that Georgia Power has been operating water line infrastructure across Plaintiffs' Property without authorization.

**17.** Georgia Power claims ownership of this waterline infrastructure, demonstrating their active participation in and control over the unauthorized utility placement.

### **D. Easement Scope Violation**

**18.** Georgia Power's use of the easement for water line infrastructure constitutes a material breach and violation of the 1984 easement scope.

**19.** The 1984 easement granted rights for "ingress and egress" only - transportation access - and contains no authorization for utility infrastructure of any kind.

**20.** By utilizing the easement area for water lines, Georgia Power has exceeded the scope of their granted rights and converted Plaintiffs' property to unauthorized uses.

**21.** Georgia Power's unauthorized utility use constitutes a taking of additional easement rights without compensation to the property owners.

### **E. Additional Utility Trespass by Third Parties**

**22.** Upon information and belief, Georgia Power has facilitated or permitted other homeowners and property owners to install and maintain water lines and other utilities across Plaintiffs' Property without authorization.

**23.** These third-party utilities serve properties beyond Georgia Power's fee-owned parcels and represent additional unauthorized use of Plaintiffs' Property.

**24.** Georgia Power's facilitation of third-party utility trespass demonstrates a pattern of exceeding easement scope and disregarding property rights.

### **F. Damages and Property Rights Interference**

**25.** As a direct result of Georgia Power's unauthorized utility use, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer damages including:

**a.** **Lost Property Value** - Unauthorized utilities reduce property marketability and development potential;

**b.** **Interference with Property Use** - Utility infrastructure limits Plaintiffs' exclusive use and possession of their property;

**c.** **Construction Interference** - Unknown utility locations complicate construction planning and increase development costs;

**d.** **Easement Value** - Georgia Power has obtained valuable utility easement rights without compensation;

**e.** **Removal and Relocation Costs** - Costs to remove unauthorized utilities or relocate development to avoid conflicts.

**27.** The 1984 easement granted Georgia Power specific, limited rights for "ingress and egress" purposes only.

**28.** Georgia Power has exceeded the scope of the granted easement by using the easement area for water line infrastructure and utilities.

**29.** This unauthorized expansion of easement use constitutes a material breach of the easement terms and a violation of Plaintiffs' property rights.

**30.** Georgia Power's easement scope violation has damaged Plaintiffs in an amount to be proven at trial, but believed to exceed $50,000.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages, injunctive relief requiring removal of unauthorized utilities, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

## **IV. COUNT II - TRESPASS**

**31.** Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

**32.** Plaintiffs are the fee simple owners of the Property and have the right to exclusive possession and use, subject only to the limited "ingress and egress" easement.

**33.** Georgia Power's installation, maintenance, and operation of water line infrastructure on Plaintiffs' Property constitutes an unauthorized entry and occupation of Plaintiffs' land.

**34.** Georgia Power's utility infrastructure physically occupies Plaintiffs' Property beyond the scope of any granted easement rights.

**35.** This unauthorized occupation constitutes a continuing trespass that interferes with Plaintiffs' exclusive property rights.

**36.** Georgia Power's trespass has damaged Plaintiffs in an amount to be proven at trial, but believed to exceed $50,000.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages, injunctive relief requiring removal of trespassing utilities, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

**37.** Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

**38.** Plaintiffs own valuable property rights in the exclusive use and possession of their Property, subject only to the limited "ingress and egress" easement.

**39.** Georgia Power has wrongfully taken and converted Plaintiffs' property rights by using their land for unauthorized utility purposes beyond the scope of any granted easement.

**40.** Georgia Power has claimed ownership of utility infrastructure placed on Plaintiffs' Property without authorization, demonstrating intent to permanently deprive Plaintiffs of their property rights.

**41.** Georgia Power's conversion of Plaintiffs' property rights has damaged Plaintiffs in an amount equal to the fair market value of the utility easement rights taken, believed to exceed $50,000.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages equal to the fair market value of the converted property rights, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

## **VI. COUNT IV - UNJUST ENRICHMENT**

**42.** Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein.

**43.** Georgia Power has received substantial benefits from the unauthorized use of Plaintiffs' Property for utility infrastructure.

**44.** These benefits include the value of utility easement rights, infrastructure placement, and ongoing utility services to Georgia Power's fee-owned properties.

**45.** Georgia Power has received these benefits at Plaintiffs' expense and without providing fair compensation to Plaintiffs.

**46.** It would be inequitable and unjust to permit Georgia Power to retain these benefits without compensating Plaintiffs for the use of their property.

**47.** Georgia Power should be required to pay Plaintiffs the reasonable value of the benefits received from the unauthorized use of Plaintiffs' Property.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendant for restitution and disgorgement of benefits unjustly retained, in an amount to be proven at trial but believed to exceed $50,000.

---

## **VII. COUNT V - NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION**

**48.** Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 47 as if fully set forth herein.

**49.** Georgia Power, through its legal counsel, represented to Plaintiffs in the May 11, 2022 letter that its rights were limited to the "non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress and egress" reserved in the 1984 deed.

**50.** Georgia Power failed to disclose its unauthorized utility use and claimed ownership of utility infrastructure beyond the scope of the granted easement.

**51.** These representations and omissions were material to Plaintiffs' understanding of their property rights and the scope of Georgia Power's authorized activities.

**52.** Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Georgia Power's representations about the scope of its easement rights in making decisions about property development and use.

**53.** Georgia Power's misrepresentations and omissions have damaged Plaintiffs by preventing them from taking appropriate action to address the unauthorized utility use.
