## COMPLETE LETTER TEXT

**RE: Property Rights at Lake Jackson**

That certain tract or parcel of land lying and being in Land Lots 68 and 73 of the 9th Land District of Butts County (the "Property"), at Lake Jackson owned by Georgia Power Company ("Georgia Power").

**Mr. and Mrs. Svoboda:**

This is to confirm Georgia Power's position with respect to its rights reserved for easements and roads located at the above Property. Pursuant to that certain deed from Georgia Power Company to James Emory, Inc., dated **June 12, 1984** (the "Deed") (attached to this letter), Georgia Power reserved a **"non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress and egress"** along the roads shown on the plats referenced in "Exhibit A" of that Deed; said roads are depicted on that certain **Plat recorded in Butts County at Book 8, Page 198** (also attached to this letter).

Specifically, the easements for ingress and egress were retained for:

- **Cemetery Road (now Short Bridge Road)**
- **Spring Drive**  
- **Two small roads identified as "Wright Drive" and "Guinn Drive"** that appear to intersect with Spring Drive at the curve about 175 feet south of Short Bridge Drive

Both easements are shown as **30-foot wide** and have a **centerline description**. **Georgia Power and its licensees have since continuously used those roads for ingress and egress to its fee-owned parcels.** Additionally, **these roads are the only means by which Georgia Power's fee-owned parcels currently have access to a public road.**

As such, Georgia Power reserves any and all rights with respect to the reserved easements, related accrued rights, and specifically the right to continue using the roads for ingress and egress for itself and its licensees without interruption or interference.

We also understand you or your agent may have cut a waterline leading to and serving Georgia Power's fee-owned parcel. While we are not clear on the facts at this moment, Georgia Power hereby reserves any and all rights with respect to the destruction of Georgia Power property.

Sincerely,

**Vanessa S. Watson**  
**Senior Counsel**  
**Georgia Power Company**

**Attachments Referenced:**
1. Limited Warranty Deed dated June 12, 1984, from Georgia Power Company to James Emory, Inc.
2. Plat dated May 1984, Drawing No. J-15-15

**cc**: Wes Lewis, Georgia Power Company

## IMPACT ON TITLE INSURANCE CLAIM

## SURVEYOR NEGLIGENCE EVIDENCE

### **Ironstone Surveying Failures**:
