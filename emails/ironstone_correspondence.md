## EMAIL 2: Pin Placement Admission
**Date**: May 2, 2022, 10:14 AM  
**From**: Office Staff <office@ironstonesurveying.com>  
**To**: Brooke  
**Subject**: Pin Location Response  

> Good Morning Brooke,
> 
> As far as the location of the pin driven into the ground- it is in the center line of the gravel rd/drive. The pin has no bearing on the boundary line. **This pin was set according to the deed** (which was very vague) on file as public record. With the information provided by the neighbor we were able to reflect the property line on the other side of the "gravel drive/road". **The pin was not able to be removed without some time of equipment to remove it. Hence, the reason it was driven into the ground** (which is an acceptable disposal method in surveying). **The exact coordinate for the pin is- N.1222153.447 E2384715.378**. I apologize for any inconvenience, however, we will not be able to come back out to mark this pin. The best I can tell you if you feel it is absolutely necessary to remove the pin is to locate it with a metal detector.

## EMAIL 3: Final Refusal & Easement Addition
**Date**: May 27, 2022, 5:37 PM  
**From**: Office Staff <office@ironstonesurveying.com>  
**To**: Brooke, Mike  
**Subject**: Final Response - Easement Update  

> Brooke/Mike,
> 
> After reviewing the warranty deeds and plats provided, and consulting with real estate attorney, Byrd Garland, Ironstone Surveying, Inc. has updated the plat for to reflect the Georgia Power Easement of Gunn Drive through your property. There is no question that Gunn Drive is a Georgia Power Easement. The Warranty Deed & Plat were both recorded. We are not attorneys, and therefore do not give legal advice. However, **once we have reviewed the documents provided on May 19, 2022 (which we did not have when we originally surveyed your property)**, we are legally bound to reflect the easement going through your property. This is in no way a personal matter, it is a matter of legality. **We initially reflected Gunn Drive on your plat, but at your insistence removed the easement because we did not have documentation at that time** to show it on the plat. Per Byrd Garland we must reflect this easement on the plat now that we have been provided that documentation. This is non-negotiable. We have informed Butts county Planning & Zoning Department and Building Department of the matter, and they have told us that the easement must be reflected on the plat as well. They have also been provided the revised plat that is attached.

> **As far as Ironstone Surveying, Inc is concerned this matter is closed. There is no need to contact our office further. We do not need to discuss this matter further, and we will not provide you with any further service in regards to this property.**
