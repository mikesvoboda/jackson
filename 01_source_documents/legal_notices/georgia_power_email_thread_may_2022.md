## EMAIL 4: COMPREHENSIVE GOOD FAITH PROPOSAL
**Date**: May 27, 2022, 12:36 PM  
**From**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  
**To**: Wesly Lewis <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  

> Hi Wes,
> **I spoke with each land leasee and I believe we are all on the same page in terms of where and how we want to handle the easements and how each person would maintain a part of the easement.** (Sue and I would share a driveway in the same area as before and would maintain that, and the other 2 landowners would maintain their portion.)
> 
> **Our plans to build at the top of the land do not affect where easements are and still leaves the 30 feet of ingress and egress for each easement.** We would like to specify exactly where those are and who is responsible for maintaining each one (with the agreement of each leasee and GA Power). **All of us are in agreement to maintain the easements ourselves, which we are assuming is what GA Power wants, but prefer an official easement be drawn up with specifics.**
> 
> The letter did not provide any contact information for the attorney. Can you please provide that?
> 
> **Is the 6/7 meeting an internal meeting or open to all? We will be in town on June 7th or could meet you earlier to walk the property.**
> 
> **I am still confident that we can come to an agreement that works for everyone involved.**
> 
> Thanks!
> --
> ~Brooke Svoboda

**üèÜ EXCEPTIONAL GOOD FAITH EVIDENCE**:
- **Community Coordination**: Spoke with each land lessee, achieved consensus
- **Cooperative Maintenance**: All parties agree to maintain easements themselves
- **Minimal Impact**: Plans don't affect easement locations, preserve 30-foot access
- **Professional Approach**: Requests official easement documentation with specifics
- **Open Communication**: Requests attorney contact information for direct dialogue
- **Collaborative Intent**: "confident that we can come to an agreement that works for everyone"
