## EMAIL 1: INITIAL EASEMENT REVISION PROPOSAL

**From**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  
**To**: Wesly Lewis <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  
**Subject**: Spring dr  

> Wes,
> This sketch represents an easy solution to our building dilemma. It addresses the potential 20 foot easement and only changes the curve of the easement. We have informally discussed this with the neighbors and feel everyone would be agreeable given this is barely any change from the current easement they are using.
> Can we get everyone together to discuss this? If this meets everyone's expectations, we can start the process of drawing it up as quickly as possible.
> Thanks

## EMAIL 5: GEORGIA POWER HARDLINE RESPONSE
**Date**: July 26, 2022, 11:18 AM  
**From**: Lewis, T. Wesly <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  
**To**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  

> Brooke,
> 
> The survey showing the easement that I'd sent to you last week along with the field work marking the easement on the ground, that's all that we'd asked Jordan to do. I don't know if Hollie has a cad file that can be shared with you. I'm still awaiting a response from my manager, specifically related to alteration of the easement location and width. **As we're all aware, there are 3 lake lessees who have been utilizing this easement for many, many years.** Communicating to these adjacent neighbors what you are wanting to do and how you will ensure that your plans will not adversely impact what they've utilized for these many years prior is imperative. I'm happy to meet all parties out there at the same time if it can be facilitated.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ADMISSION**: "3 lake lessees who have been utilizing this easement for many, many years" - Evidence of continuous use claims and third-party beneficiaries.

## EMAIL 6: COORDINATE REQUEST AND MEETING PROPOSAL
**Date**: July 26, 2022, 6:49 PM  
**From**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  
**To**: Wesly Lewis <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  

> Thanks Wes,
> Would you like us to contact the owners or would you? We can do any day the week of Aug 15th or Aug 22.
> In the meantime, **there are no coordinates on this drawing you gave us for the easement. I marked the 4 places that we would like to see coordinates for, but we would need info on where the centerline of the y begins and also where the Gunn drive curves. There isn't a point of beginning marked here or the typical information you would find on a survey.** Could you please give us a call tomorrow?
> Thanks
> 
> --
> ~Brooke Svoboda

**Legal Significance**: Evidence that Georgia Power's survey documentation lacked proper coordinates and professional survey standards.

## EMAIL 7: GEORGIA POWER DEFLECTION ON COORDINATES
**Date**: July 26, 2022, 7:28 PM  
**From**: Lewis, T. Wesly <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  
**To**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  
**Attachments**: 2 Attachments  

> Brooke,
> 
> I can reach out to the neighboring lessees to organize a meeting but I'd suggest you put something together in advance of this meeting and send to them, cc me. I'd notify these lessees that you are requesting to relocate the easement minimally, reduce the width of the easement to 20' and bare the legal costs of recording a new easement and survey so long as its acceptable to all parties.
> 
> **The legend in the top right hand corner of the attached (1) survey, the second icon is a solid black circle which depicts "Solid Rod Rebar Found." Jordan didn't set new pins, they re-identified those that were already there.** Also, there are bearings and coordinates on those back line pins between our property and yours. **Regarding your request below, again, Jordan found the pins that were there. I don't know what else to say to you other than that.** The markings are on the ground, the new survey is attached along with the original survey, deed and easement from Georgia Power's selling of this parcel. **If you would like for Jordan to set pins in the requested locations, and include bearings and coordinates, you'll likely be able to when/if you revise the current easement.**
> 
> **At this point, there's nothing for us to discuss. I want to reach a resolution that does not adversely impact our lessees and your neighbors but helps get you what you need - I hope that's your goal as well. That should be evidenced by the fact that we have paid a surveyor to come out and do this field work and I've exhausted more time than I'd like or have with our legal counsel over this issue.**

**From**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  
**To**: Wesly Lewis <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  

> Hi Wes,
> Is there any update on this situation?

## EMAIL 9: GEORGIA POWER FINAL HARDLINE POSITION
**Date**: August 8, 2022, 8:32 AM  
**From**: Lewis, T. Wesly <TWLEWIS@southernco.com>  
**To**: Brooke Svoboda <brooke.svoboda@gmail.com>  

> Mrs. Svoboda,
> 
> **I've spoken to Hollie Hall at Jordan and according to her research between the Ironstone survey and Jordans' â€“ they are almost identical with regard to their bearings and calls on your property.**
> 
> **GPC is open to the option of the easement being revised but as reiterated from the beginning, we are not interested in any type of alteration that would adversely affect our long held rights at this location.** I've also spoken with Brad Vaughan at Butts Co. and there are specific items that they are awaiting from you regarding the development of this property as well.
> 
> **I expect GPC to provide a list of our requirements to you with regard to the possible revision of the easement in the near future but understand that what we send will be non-negotiable. We retained these rights in 1984.**

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL LEGAL ADMISSIONS**:
- **"Ironstone survey and Jordans' â€“ they are almost identical"** - Contradicts coordinate fraud claims
- **"Non-negotiable"** - Evidence of bad faith negotiation
- **"We retained these rights in 1984"** - Assertion of superior rights
- Coordination with Butts County officials
